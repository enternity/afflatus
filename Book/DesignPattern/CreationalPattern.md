## Factory Method 

> View on: [https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/factory-method](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/factory-method)

1. **Application** :
- Use the Factory Method when you _**donâ€™t know beforehand the exact types and dependencies**_ of the objects your code should work with.
- Use the Factory Method when you want to _**provide users of your library or framework with a way to extend its internal components**_.
- Use the Factory Method when you want to _**save system resources by reusing existing objects**_ instead of rebuilding them each time.
