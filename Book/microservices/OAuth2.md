# Short brief OAuth

	OAuth operates by creating a secure connection between the user, the third-party application, and the service provider through a series of authorization and authentication steps. The user first grants permission to the third-party application to access their resources, which generates an access token that is used by the application to access the user's resources. The access token is a temporary and revocable credential that is specific to the user, the application, and the service provider.

# Different OAuth vs OAuth2

1.  Simpler flow: OAuth2 simplifies the authorization flow by introducing several grant types, such as the Authorization Code Grant and the Implicit Grant, that are tailored to specific use cases and security requirements.
    
2.  Access token management: OAuth2 introduces a standardized format for access tokens and defines how they should be issued, authenticated, and revoked. This allows for better interoperability between different service providers and client applications.
    
3.  Scope-based authorization: OAuth2 introduces the concept of scopes, which are a set of permissions that define what resources and operations a client application can access on behalf of the user. Scopes provide a finer-grained authorization model than OAuth1, which only supported a binary authorized/denied decision.
    
4.  Extensibility: OAuth2 is designed to be extensible, which allows for the development of custom grant types and extensions that can meet specific business or security requirements.
    
5.  Better security: OAuth2 introduces several security improvements, such as the use of HTTPS and the requirement of clients to register with the service provider before obtaining access tokens.
