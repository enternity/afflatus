# BEAN LIFE-CYCLE MANAGEMENT

> In general, two life-cycle events are particularly relevant to a bean: _**post-initialization and pre-destruction**_.

> Spring provides three mechanisms a bean can use to hook into each of these events and perform some additional processing: _**interface-based, method-based, and annotation-based mechanisms**_.
