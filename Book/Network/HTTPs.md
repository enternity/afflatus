# What is HTTPs?
- Hypertext transfer protocol secure is the secure version of HTTP. HTTPs is encrypted in order to increase security if data transfer.
# How does HTTPs work?
- HTTPs uses an encryption protocol to encrypt communications. The protocol is called [Transport Layer Security (TLS)](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/transport-layer-security-tls/), althorugh formerly it was known as [Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/what-is-ssl/)
# What is the difference between TLS and SSL?
- TLS evolved from a previous encryption protocol called Secure Socket Layer. TLS version 1.0 actually began development as SSL version 3.1, but the name of the protocol was changed before publication in order to indicate that it was no long associated with Netscape.
# What does TLS do?
1. **Encryption** : hides the data being transferred from third parties.
2. **Authentication** : ensures that the parties exchanging information are who the claim to be.
3. **Integrity** : verifies that the data has not been forged or tampered with.
