# Dynamic Programing 
> Abstract Solution
1. **Find a recursive relation.** If you are already have your recursive relation, go to the implementation stage which starts from (4). Read the problem carefully, and find out if you could divide the problem into sub‐problems. The most important thing for the dynamic programming pattern is that you should prove that the solution of the higher‐level problem expressed in optimal solutions of the sub‐ problems is optimal. This part might be tough; if you can’t figure out a recursive relation, try the divide‐and‐conquer pattern or the backtrack, branch‐and‐bound pattern. By doing that you might find a recursive relation between sub‐problems.
2. **What is the answer of the problem?** Now express your global optimal solution in terms of the recursive relation that you found in the previous stage (1).
3.
