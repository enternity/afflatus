# Binary Heap
## Binary heap is a Binary Tree with following properties
1. It's a complete tree.
2. A binary heap is either Min heap or Max heap. In a Min Binary Heap, the key at root must be a minimum among all keys present in Binary Heap. The same property must be recursively true for all nodes in Binary Tree. Max Binary Heap is similar to Min H
