### Use Intention-Revealing Names
### Avoid Disinformation
- Programmers _**must avoid**_ leaving false clues that obscure the meaning of code. We _**should avoid**_ words whose entrenched meanings vary from our intended meaning.
### Make Meaningful Distinctions
- If names must be different, then they should also mean something different.
- Distinguish names in such a way that the reader knows what the differences offer.
### Use Pronounceable Names
- When ever you write functions, classes. It's must be can called by name. Ex: ```generateRandomDate()``` instead of ```grd()```
### Use Searchable Names
### Avoid Encodings
- No need [Hungarian Notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_notation) which is the past.
- Also no need member prefixes.
- We also don't need prefix for interfaces or abstract classes. Ex: ```IShapeFactory, or CShapeFactory```. 
### Avoid Metal Mapping
- Clarity is a king. Professionals use their powers for good and write code that others can understand.
### Class Names.
- Classes and Objects should have noun or noun phrase names like Customer, WikiPage, Account. Avoid words like Manager, Processor, Data and Info in the name of a class. A class name shouldn't be a verb.
### Method Names.
- Method name should have verb or verb phrase
- When constructors are overloaded, use static factory methods with names that describe the arguments
### Pick One Word Per Concept
- Pick one word for one abstract concept and stick with it.
- A consistent lexicon is a great boon to the programers who must use your code.
### Don't Pun
- Avoid using the same word for two purposes.
- Add meaningful context.
### Use Solution Domain Names
- Use computer science(CS) term, algorithm names, pattern names, math terms, and so forth.
- Choosing technical names for those things is usually the most appropriate course
### Use Problem Domain Names
- The code that has more to do with problem domain concepts should have names drawn from the problem domain.
### Add Meaningful Context
### Don’t Add Gratuitous Context
- In an imaginary application called “Gas Station Deluxe,” it is a bad idea to prefix every class with GSD.
