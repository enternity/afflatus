### Use Intention-Revealing Names
### Avoid Disinformation
- Programmers _**must avoid**_ leaving false clues that obscure the meaning of code. We _**should avoid**_ words whose entrenched meanings vary from our intended meaning.
### Make Meaningful Distinctions
- If names must be different, then they should also mean something different.
- Distinguish names in such a way that the reader knows what the differences offer.
### Use Pronounceable Names
- When ever you write functions, classes. It's must be can called by name. Ex: ```generateRandomDate()``` instead of ```grd()```
### Use Searchable Names
### Avoid Encodings
- Don't need [Hungarian Notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_notation) which is the past.
