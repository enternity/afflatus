### Use Intention-Revealing Names
### Avoid Disinformation
- Programmers _**must avoid**_ leaving false clues that obscure the meaning of code. We _**should avoid**_ words whose entrenched meanings vary from our intended meaning.
### Make Meaningful Distinctions
- If names must be different, then they should also mean something different.
- Distinguish names in such a way that the reader knows what the differences offer.
### Use Pronounceable Names
