# RETRIEVING RECORD 
> _Main responsibility_ : Focus on **SELECT** statement.

## Retrieving All Rows and Columns from a Table
```sql
SELECT * FROM studentinfo
```
> However, when writing program code, itâ€™s _**better to specify each column individually**_. The performance will be the same, but by being explicit you will always know what columns you are returning from the query. Likewise, such queries are easier to understand by

```sql
SELECT name, grade, gender
FROM studentinfo
```
