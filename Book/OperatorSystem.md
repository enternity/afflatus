## Tại sao boolean value chỉ cần 1 bit giá trị để lưu true/false (1/0) mà cần tận tới 1byte?
- In [computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing "Computing"), a **virtual address space** (**VAS**) or **[address space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_space "Address space")** is the set of ranges of virtual addresses that an [operating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system "Operating system") makes available to a process.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_address_space#cite_note-1) The range of virtual addresses usually starts at a low address and can extend to the highest address allowed by the computer's [instruction set architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instruction_set "Instruction set") and supported by the [operating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system "Operating system")'s pointer size implementation, which can be 4 [bytes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bytes "Bytes") for [32-bit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/32-bit "32-bit") or 8 [bytes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bytes "Bytes") for [64-bit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/64-bit "64-bit") OS versions. This provides several benefits, one of which is security through [process isolation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_isolation "Process isolation") assuming each process is given a separate [address space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_space "Address space").
- When a new application on a [32-bit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/32-bit "32-bit") OS is executed, the process has a 4  [GiB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibibyte "Gibibyte") VAS: each one of the [memory addresses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_address "Memory address") (from 0 to 232 − 1) in that space can have a single byte as a value. Initially, none of them have values ('-' represents no value). Using or setting values in such a VAS would cause a [memory exception](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_fault "Page fault").
