# WHAT IS ARCHITECTURE?

> The _**primary purpose**_ of architecture is to _support the life cycle of system_. Good architecture makes the system easy to understand, easy to develop, easy to maintain, and easy to develop. The _**ultimate goal**_ is _minimize the lifetime cost of the system and maximize programer productivity_. 

# COMPONENT OF ARCHITECTURE ?

## OPERATION 
## MAINTAINENCE
