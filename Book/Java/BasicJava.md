# Stack memory 
> _Stack memory is responsible for holding references to heap objects and for storing value types (also known in Java as primitive types), which hold the value itself rather than a reference to an object from the heap._

# Minimize mutability
- To make class immutable, we have 5 rules:
1. Don't provide methods that modify objects state
2. Ensure that the class can't be extended (make class final)
3. Make all fields final
4. Make all fields private
5. Ensure exclusive access to any mutable components
