# ENUM
#### Advice 1 : Use enum instead of int constants
1. Enum is _**constant variables**_ that mean we need to recompile the program if enum variable have been changed. The enum make program don't run incorrect state which we want.
2. Enum constants make readable string output.
3. Provide compile-time type safety.
4. Enum is singleton.
5. **To associate data with enum constants, declare instance fields and write a constructor that takes the data and stores it in the fields.**
6. Some behaviors associated with enum constants may need to be used only from within the class or package in which the enum is defined. Such behaviors are best implemented as private or package-private methods.
7. Declare abstract method if each enum have specific behavior.
Example :
```java
public enum Operation {  
	PLUS {publicdoubleapply(doublex,doubley){returnx+y;}}, 
	MINUS {public double apply(double x, double y){return x - y;}}, 
	TIMES {public double apply(double x, double y){return x * y;}}, 
	DIVIDE{public double apply(double x, double y){return x / y;}};

	public abstract double apply(double x, double y);
}
```

8. Enum types have an automatically generated valueOf(String) method that translates a constantâ€™s name into the constant itself.
9. Don't use switch case or if else if behavior of function change follow enum respectively. Switches on enums are good for augmenting enum types with constant-specific behavior
